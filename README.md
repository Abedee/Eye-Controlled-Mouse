# Eye Controlled Mouse

## Description

The **Eye Controlled Mouse** project enables users to control their computerâ€™s mouse pointer using their eye movements, leveraging computer vision and facial landmarks detection techniques. This Python-based project uses `OpenCV` for camera feed processing, `MediaPipe` for face and eye landmark detection, and `PyAutoGUI` to interact with the screen. The main aim is to provide an accessible and hands-free interface for controlling the mouse, offering potential benefits for users with physical disabilities or those looking for alternative input methods.

## Features
- Tracks eye movements to control the mouse cursor.
- Detects blinking to simulate mouse clicks.
- Uses facial landmark detection with refined eye tracking.
- Real-time video processing and responsive interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV**: For real-time video capture and image processing.
- **MediaPipe**: For detecting facial landmarks and refining eye movements.
- **PyAutoGUI**: For simulating mouse pointer movements and clicks.
  
## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
- `opencv-python`
- `mediapipe`
- `pyautogui`

You can install the dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
```

### Running the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eye-controlled-mouse.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd eye-controlled-mouse
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python eye_controlled_mouse.py
   ```

The camera will open, and the system will start tracking your eye movements to control the mouse cursor. Blinking will trigger mouse clicks.

## Usage
- Move your eyes to control the pointer.
- A small green circle will indicate the points being tracked for the eye.
- Blink to simulate a mouse click (detected by comparing the vertical distances of specific facial landmarks).
  
## Project Structure
- `eye_controlled_mouse.py`: Main script that runs the program.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains the list of required Python libraries (optional).

## Future Improvements
- Add support for both eyes to enhance precision.
- Improve the click detection to avoid false positives.
- Implement scroll functionality through eye gestures.
